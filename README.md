LibFt - 42 School Project by Clément ABRAHAM

Welcome to my LibFt repository! This project is part of the 42 School curriculum, focusing on recreating essential C library functions from scratch. Each function has been crafted with the goal of deepening my understanding of low-level programming while pushing me towards coding excellence. Here’s a bit more about me, my journey, and the work done in this project.

Project Overview 📚

In this repository, I tackle the LibFt project. This project is a fundamental part of the 42 curriculum, requiring the recreation of several functions from the C standard library. Here’s a list of completed functions and current focuses:

Completed Functions 🏆

	•	Core functions such as substr, strtrim, itoa, strmapi, striteri, and many more.
	•	Specific tasks in progress, like ft_putchar_fd and related _fd functions.

Bonus Section 🔥

I’m now diving into the bonus part of the project, adding additional functionality and extending the scope of the library. This extra work allows me to deepen my knowledge and refine my programming skills.
